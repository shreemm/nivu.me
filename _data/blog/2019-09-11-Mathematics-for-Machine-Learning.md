In this post I have compiled great e-resources for learning Mathematics for Machine Learning.

_It doesn‚Äôt matter what catches your fancy, machine learning, artificial intelligence, or deep learning; you need to know the basics of math and stats‚Äîlinear algebra, calculus, optimization, probability‚Äîto get ahead._

_**Math is a specific, powerful vocabulary for ideas and giving a structure to the way you learn it will empower you to absorb much more of it much faster.**_

I have added links to MOOCsüéì, YouTube‚ñ∂Ô∏è Playlists and Free e-booksüìö.

## Understanding Mathematics

[The Map of Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmJ-4B-mS-Y) by [MajorPrep](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpCSAcbqs-sjEVfk_hMfY9w) _The entire field of mathematics summarised in a single map! This shows how pure mathematics and applied mathematics relate to each other and all of the sub-topics they are made from._

[How to Learn Mathematics Fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzfdL58virc) by [Siraj Raval](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A) _Whether you're interested in AI or you just want to do some real engineering work, you‚Äôre going to need to brush up on your math skills. In this video, I‚Äôll describe my strategy to learn mathematics as fast as possible._

## MOOC üéì

[Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning) by [Imperial College London on Coursera](http://coursera.org)

_This specialization aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying mathematics, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science._

_In the first course on [Linear Algebra](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning) we look at what linear algebra is and how it relates to data. Then we look through what vectors and matrices are and how to work with them._

_The second course, [Multivariate Calculus](https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning), builds on this to look at how to optimize fitting functions to get good fits to data. It starts from introductory calculus and then uses the matrices and vectors from the first course to look at data fitting._

_The third course, [Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Component Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/pca-machine-learning), uses the mathematics from the first two courses to compress high-dimensional data. This course is of intermediate difficulty and will require basic Python and numpy knowledge._

_At the end of this specialization you will have gained the prerequisite mathematical knowledge to continue your journey and take more advanced courses in machine learning._

_This book written by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani is meant for non-math students._

_The TOC includes linear regression, classification, resampling methods, linear model and regularization, tree-based methods, shrinkage approaches, clustering, support vector machines, and unsupervised learning._

_With interesting real-world examples and attractive graphics, this is a great text for statistical tools and techniques._

Free Book: [Download here](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/)

### The Elements of Statistical Learning

_Authors Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman (all three are Stanford professors) discuss supervised learning, linear methods of regression and classification, kernel smoothing methods, regularization, model selection and assessment, additive trees, SVM, neural networks, random forests, nearest neighbors, unsupervised learning, ensemble methods, and more._

### Deep Learning

_This what Elon Musk, co-founder of Tesla Motors, has to say about this definitive text written by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville: ‚ÄúWritten by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject‚Äù._

_The authors talk about applied math and machine learning basics, deep networks and modern practices, and deep learning research._

_For engineers interested in neural networks, this could well be their bible._

Free Book: [Download here](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

### Neural Networks and Deep Learning

_Michael Nielsen‚Äôs free online book is a comprehensive text on the core concepts of deep learning and artificial neural networks._

_The book has great interactive elements, but it does not provide solutions for the exercises. Laid out like a narrative, Nielsen holds onto core math and code to explain the key ideas._

_He talks about back propagation, hyper parameter optimization, activation functions, neural networks as functional approximates, regularization, a little about convolution neural networks, etc._

### Math Solving Platforms üéÆ

[Brilliant Org](https://brilliant.org) _Brilliant creates a culture of learning around inquiry, curiosity, and openness to failure. All of our courses are written with these principles of learning in mind._

[WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com) _The introduction of Wolfram|Alpha defined a fundamentally new paradigm for getting knowledge and answers‚Äînot by searching the web, but by doing dynamic computations based on a vast collection of built-in data, algorithms and methods. Bringing broad, deep, expert-level knowledge to everyone‚Ä¶ anytime, anywhere._
