description: Definitive guide to learn Machine Learning
---

So a lot of people have asked me how to get started with AI and learn MAchine Learning? And I have answerd more than hundreds of them.
Now I started receiving messages daily with the same question. So, this time I thought lets do a blog on "How to get started with Machie leraning and become a PRO".

How I got into AI, I was from electronics background. My undergraduate is Electronics & Communication Engineering (ECE) and I was an out and out Hardcore HArdware Enginneer, I do Circuit Designs, PCBs, Microcoontrollers, Embedded Programming, C C++, wires and stuffs.

And then I was doing Networking (CCNA), then Web development (HTML, CSS, JS, Php) and Wireless Sensor Networks. It's already seemed a lot for me.üò´ And then college was over (2015), I have no idea what to do.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

My self and my joined my professors startup and we were working on IoT (The The The Internet of Things). As AI was a buzz today, IoT was a buzz then. People were working with Arduinos, RaspberryPis, ESPs (these are for kidsüë∂ u knw LOL :P), we were building industry standard IoT systems (ARM, Microchip, TI) with Sensors and Radios (GHz).

‡Æï‡Ææ‡Æ≤‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ©‡Øç ‡Æï‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡Ææ‡ÆØ‡ÆÆ‡Øç (force of time), I got join MS (by research) at Center for Research, Anna University. And got to work with Advanced IoT, LoRa, Thread, Cognitive Radio, NB-IoT and 5G. Life seems to be going hard and interesting.

ü§î Why am I telling this? this isn't my biopic right? who caresü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

OK, lets get back to the story, even thought I already switched career many times from Electronics -> Embedded -> Networking -> Web Development -> Internet of Things why in the world I wanted to become an **AI developer**

_I forgot a few, I was doing Freelancing during my MS (Java, Spring, NodeJs, REST, Angular, ReactJs, GCP, AWS, Ionic, Android, Docker)_

One fine day (2018) I was watching an YouTube videoüé¨ and they were discussing on _How to land Drone on a Moving Car_, I was stunned, even I tried to fly a remote controlled drone and broke one. It seemed like an imposible task for me. But they have done it...!! They told it's using Machine Learning.üòÆ And, I already started watching tutorials.

I began looking into Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
There‚Äôs so much going on. Too much. Every week it seems like Google or Facebook are releasing a new kind of AI to make things faster or improve our experience. Self-driving cars were popping out and the world's first robot citizen Sophia was showing off.

Even with all this happening, there‚Äôs still yet to be an agreed definition of what exactly artificial intelligence is.
Some argue deep learning can be considered AI, others will say it‚Äôs not AI unless it passes the Turing Test.

This lack of definition really stunted my progress in the beginning. It was hard to learn something which had so many different definitions.

I was starting to hearing more and more about ML and AI.
*‚ÄúThe computer learns things for you?‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt believe it.*üòÆ

## My Self-Created AI Master's Degree

I didn‚Äôt plan on going back to university anytime soon. I didn‚Äôt have \$100,000 for a proper Master's Degree anyway.
So I did what I did in the beginning. Asked my mentor, Google, for help.

I knew online courses had a high drop out rate. I wasn‚Äôt going to let myself be a part of this number. I had a mission.

As my entire AI education is online, I have never been to any institution but now I got to teach Faculties, Phd Scholars and do corporate trainings.
It is Mostly from free MOOCs and YouTube videos, I don't prefer books, but I read a lot online (coz they are updated often).
Google, Stackoverflow, Quora, Medium, Github, Communities helped me a lot in my learning journey.

## How do you start?

Where do you go to learn these skills? What courses are the best?
There‚Äôs no best answer. Everyone‚Äôs path will be different. Some people learn better with books, others learn better through videos.
What‚Äôs more important than how you start is why you start.
Start with why.
Why do you want to learn these skills?
Do you want to make money?
Do you want to build things?
Do you want to make a difference?
There‚Äôs no right reason. All are valid in their own way.
Start with why because having a why is more important than how. Having a why means when it gets hard and it will get hard, you‚Äôve got something to turn to. Something to remind you why you started.
Got a why? Good. Time for some hard skills.

# Now comes the Technical part

If you‚Äôre an absolute beginner, start with some introductory Python courses and when you‚Äôre a bit more confident, move into data science, machine learning and AI. DataCamp is great for beginners learning Python but wanting to learn it with a data science and machine learning focus.

I highly prefer [Python Programming Tutorials by Socratica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY6m6_IIN94&list=PLi01XoE8jYohWFPpC17Z-wWhPOSuh8Er-)

If you prefer some online course like MOOCs
**Coursera** offers a more official version [Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python). It includes the videos from the free course, but with the addition of extra readings, quizzes, and a certificate.

Is watching these videos and completing this course is enough?

**Nooooooooooo**

Go to [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) or [LeetCode](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and solve 50 problems. Then you get into AI and ML, coz 50% in Machine Learning is actually software engineering. If you don't now basic data structures & algorithms and struggle to iterate over a simple array, things don't work that way.

### Python is enough?

Yeah it can do most of the job, but you need some handy tools and libraries to make life easier. They are Numpy (Matrix and Linear Algebra), Pandas(Dataframes and Data Manipulation), Matplotlib (Plotting and Visualizing) and scikit-learn (??).

# Now lets come to Machine Learning?

Machine learning is learning from data, it's that simple. You don't have to write hard coded rules for every edge cases, the algorithms is gonna learn for you and derive all the rules from the data. You just have to choose a proper Algotithms and feed your data and the AI is ready.

# How much math?

The highest level of math education I‚Äôve had was in high school. The rest I‚Äôve learned through Khan Academy as I‚Äôve needed it.

If you want to apply machine learning and AI techniques to a problem, you don‚Äôt necessarily need an in-depth understanding of the math to get a good result. Libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch allow someone with a bit of Python experience to build state of the art models whilst the math is taken care of behind the scenes.
If you‚Äôre looking to get deep into machine learning and AI research, through means of a PhD program or something similar, having an in-depth knowledge of the math is paramount.

Things to do

- Keep Trask of your progress
- Find a mentor
- Join a Community

# Final Thoughts

No set path
There‚Äôs no right or wrong way to get into ML or AI (or anything else).
The beautiful thing about this field is we have access to some of the best technologies in the world, all we‚Äôve got to do is learn how to use them.
You could begin by learning Python code (my favourite).
You could begin by studying calculus and statistics.
You could begin by learning about the philosophy of decision making.
Machine learning and AI fascinate me because they meet at the intersection of all of these.
The more I learn about it, the more I realise there‚Äôs plenty more to learn. And it gets me excited.

Sometimes I get frustrated when my code doesn‚Äôt run. Or I don‚Äôt understand a concept.

There‚Äôs so much happening in the field it can be daunting to get started. Too many options lead to no options. Ignore this.

Computers are smart but they still can‚Äôt learn on their own. They need your help.
