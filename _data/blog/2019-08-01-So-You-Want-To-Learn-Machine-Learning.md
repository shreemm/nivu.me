## Python

**Dr. Chuck**'s (Prof. Charles Severance) [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/) is free. There is an accomanying book with the same title.

**Coursera** offers a more official version [Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python). It includes the videos from the free course, but with the addition of extra readings, quizzes, and a certificate.
